			<h2>Tiger Facts</h2>
		
			<ol>
				Tigers are the largest cat species in the world reaching up to 3.3 meters in length and weighing up to 670 pounds!
				Tigers are easily recognizable with their dark vertical stripes and reddish/orange fur.
				The Bengal tiger is the most common tiger.
				Tigers live between 20-26 years in the wild.
				Unlike most other cats, tigers are great swimmers and actually like the water.

			<h2>Giraffe</h2>

			<p><font size="5">Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humans—about 6 feet . These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances.</font></p>

			<h7><font size="5"><b>Behavior</b></font></h7>

			<p>Typically, these fascinating animals roam the open grasslands in small groups of about half a dozen.</font></p>

			<p>Bulls sometimes battle one another by butting their long necks and heads. Such contests aren't usually dangerous and end when one animal submits and walks away.</p>
			<h8><font size="5"><b>Height and Size</b></font></h8>

			<p>Giraffes use their height to good advantage and browse on leaves and buds in treetops that few other animals can reach (acacias are a favorite). Even the giraffe's tongue is long! The 21-inch tongue helps them pluck tasty morsels from branches. Giraffes eat most of the time and, like cows, regurgitate food and chew it as cud. A giraffe eats hundreds of pounds of leaves each week and must travel miles to find enough food.</p>
